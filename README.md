566 final project




Report highlights of out experiments (does not have to be well-phrased or anything.. just to use later for documentation)

- The dataset we are using has some mismatches as some images do not have captions.. and some captions' images are removed for copyright issues. We had to handle that during our preprocessing.

etc


to-do:

- fix batch generator

- use glove instead of one-hot-vector

- loss would be either [cosine diff | eucludian dist]

- train lstm

- change to gru and train



What we are planning to experiment with:

- GRU and LSTM for first model (for speed and accuracy)
- both RNNS with BERT, which is producing better output
- (results) Random images to stories check with final model
